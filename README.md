*   Sex - Male or Female
*   Age - Current Age
*   Country  - Which Country do you live in?
*   Education  - Highest Level of Education
*   Ethnicity

**Problem Statement Identification:**
Investigating salary discrepancies and job satisfaction amongst data professionals based on factors such as job role, industry, demographic, sex, programming language, relationship with coworkers, management, upward mobiliity opportunities. learning environment and ethnicity.

**Insight:** 
There's a significant disproportion between the number of male and female data professionals who participated in the survey.

Data scientists consistently earn the highest salaries compared to other roles within the data industry, indicating that their specialized skills and expertise are highly valued in the job market. This suggests that individuals pursuing careers in data science may have greater earning potential relative to other data-related professions.

In the realm of data professions, women outpaced men in earnings, marking a significant shift in gender-based income differentials within the field. This trend underscores a promising stride towards gender parity and recognition of female expertise in data-related roles.

Males significantly outnumber females especially in the Data Analysis profession, indicating a gender imbalance within this specific profession. Addressing this gap is crucial for fostering diversity and inclusivity in data-driven industries.

There are more outliers among older individuals who didn't transition into data professions compared to those who did switch careers meaning those who remained in their original professions have more extreme values (outliers) compared to those who transitioned into data-related professions.

Data professionals aged between 25 and 35 earn the highest average yearly salary. This suggests that individuals within this age range tend to command higher salaries in the data industry compared to other age groups.

Both male and female data professionals rated the level of difficulty in breaking into the data field as moderate, with the highest response frequency. This indicates that both genders perceive the challenge of entering the data industry similarly, neither finding it excessively easy nor overly difficult.

Data professionals with a Ph.D. education level earned significantly higher salaries compared to those with lower levels of education. This suggests that advanced educational qualifications, such as a Ph.D., are associated with higher earning potential in the data industry.

In the United States, data professionals specializing in Java programming language earn the highest average yearly salary. This indicates that Java developers in the United States enjoy the highest compensation among data professionals using different programming languages.

The median salary is relatively high, suggesting that a significant portion of the data points falls above the median. Additionally, the single outlier indicates an exceptionally high salary within the dataset.
